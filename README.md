# Project Name

**Author**: Jon Armstrong
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
A backend for the city-explorer app.

## Getting Started
All interaction should be through the city-explorer app.  The user should not have to interact directly with this server.

## Architecture
This server has been built with NodeJS, NPM, Express, dotenv, JSON.

Construction was performed on a Windows system, running services through Windows Subsystem for Linux - Ubuntu, and Visual Studio Code.

Additional services have been provided by GitHub.com, Netlify.com, Replit.com, and Trello.com.
